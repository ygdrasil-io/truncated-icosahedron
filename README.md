that appears to the left of the `suspend fun main()` line.

Using gradle tasks on the terminal:

```bash
./gradlew runJvm                    # Runs the program
./gradlew packageJvmFatJar          # Creates a FAT Jar with the program
./gradlew packageJvmFatJarProguard  # Creates a FAT Jar with the program and applies Proguard to reduce the size
```

Fat JARs are stored in the `/build/libs` folder.
